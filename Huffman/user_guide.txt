Application Usage

1. `cd` to `src` subfolder
2. Execute the following command:
java Main <encode|decode|info> <file>
- encode|decode|info - one of three modes this application supports;
- file - a `.txt` file containing a message for encoding/decoding

Examples
1. Encode command:
java Main encode input.txt

After that a new file `input.txt.encoded.txt` will be created with the encoded
message in it.

2. Decode command:
java Main decode out.txt

After that a new file `out.txt.restored.txt` will be created with the restored
message in it.

3. Info command:
java Main info out.txt

After that the decoded file will be created and the program will provide the
following information:
- Encoded file size in bytes
- Decoded file size in bytes
- Degree of compression(less than 1 means that encoded message is smaller
than the decoded message and the algorithm works)
- Generated Huffman's tree
